Music Playlist Using Circular Linked List
This project aims at creating a more sophisticated and flexible music playlist which
grants user the access to a wide variety of functionality. The user is provided with the
opportunity to create a playlist out of the songs available on his desktop.
This ensures a more feasible and efficient insertion and removal of nodes at arbitrary
positions. This is ideal for a playlist because it allows the user to insert and delete songs
at any position.
Circular Linked List is a very efficient way to create and modify a song playlist. It can
be used to make a flexible playlist providing the user with a wide variety of
functionality. This coupled with the PlaySound paves the way to an ideal music player
that can access the songs on the userâ€™s desktop.
The Time complexity of manipulating the position of the elements is O (n). Unlike in
arrays, altering the position of one element does not affect the others which makes it far
less time consuming.
